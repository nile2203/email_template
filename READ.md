This is a responsive email template. You wont be able to see the images as I have removed the sources. But if you add your own source for the images, the template will be good to go. 
You can adjus the size of images and text based on your own requirements. I have made the template keeping in mind the standard and best accecpted practices I have came accross. Altough, some other methodology to make the can be there, but this template works fine for most of the clients including Gmail, Outlook etc.
Feel Free to drop comments andd issues if any. Happy to answer them!
